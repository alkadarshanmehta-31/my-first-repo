DEVOPS HACKTHON:
DevOps = Development + Operations

*Developers-(who writes code)
*Operations-(who develop/manage systems)
-works together, instead of working in silos

Real time example:
Imagine developing a mobile app like swiggy.
The developer writes code to add "Track My order feature".
Without DevOps: Developers gives code to Ops team-they manually deploy-bugs happen-delays.

DevOps Helps You:
Release features faster.
Fix bugs quickly.
Automate repetitive tasks.

GitHub Basics:
Git = Version control system(local).
GitHub = Online platform to store Git projects.
